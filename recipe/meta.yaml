  summary: 'Software for Roentdek detector'
  description: |
    This is a binary distribution from Achim
    Czasch <czasch@atom.uni-frankfurt.de>,
    received through email with Mikhail and
    Timur, for working with a detector
    discussed here: http://www.roentdek.com/,
    see the email-czachim.txt file in the
    source distribution. We're only going to
    take the static lib and header file and
    put it in the conda release.
